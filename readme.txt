pigscript 1.0
Please help me improve the code!
My email: pigscript@gmail.com

Tested work on windows 7 & 8 on chrome browser.
Screen resolution may matter, so draw a small test picture first.

How to draw:
	1. Run the code or the .exe file.
	2. Follow the instructions on the command line.
	3. Switch to drawball.com, enable full screen, and choose the pen size.
	4. Use Alt+Tab to switch to the command window and hit any key to start painting.
	
Caution:
	1. If the image is large(>600*600), it may take several seconds to load.
	2. If the image is too complicated(has more than 5 major colors), it may take very long to draw, 
	and the output picture may look slightly different.
